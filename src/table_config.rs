/// A `DistanceFunction` can be any function that returns a scalar distance when given two keys.  The smaller the
/// distance, the closer the match.  Two identical keys must have a distance of [zero](num_traits::Zero).  The `fuzzy` methods
/// in this crate, such as [lookup_fuzzy](crate::Table::lookup_fuzzy), invoke the distance function to determine
/// if two keys adequately match.
///
/// This crate includes a simple [Levenstein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) function
/// called [levenstein_distance](TableConfig::levenstein_distance).  However, you may often want to use a different function.
///
/// One reason to use a custom distance function is to account for expected error patterns. For example:
/// a distance function that considers likely [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
/// errors might consider 'lo' to be very close to 'b', '0' to be extremely close to 'O', and 'A' to be
/// somewhat near to '^', while '!' would be much further from '@' even though the Levenstein distances
/// tell a different story with 'lo' being two edits away from 'b' and '!' being only one edit away from
/// '@'.
///
/// In another situation, you may want to use a custom distance function that is aware of key positions on a QWERTY keyboard, and
/// thus able to identify likely typos.  In such a distance function, '!' and '@' are now very close
/// because they are adjacent keys.
///
/// In another example, a distance function may be used to identify words that are similar in pronunciation,
/// like the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm, or you may have any number of
/// other application-specific requirements.
///
/// Another reason for a custom distance function is if your keys are not human-readable strings, in which
/// case you may need a different interpretation of variances between keys.  For example DNA snippets could
/// be used as keys to search for genetic mutations.
///
/// Distance functions must return a [DistanceT](TableConfig::DistanceT).
///
/// Any distance function you choose must be compatible with SymSpell's delete-distance optimization.  In other
/// words, you must be able to delete no more than [MAX_DELETES](TableConfig::MAX_DELETES) characters from both
/// a given record's key and the lookup key and arrive at identical key-variants.  If your distance function
/// is incompatible with this property then the SymSpell optimization won't work for you and you should use
/// a different fuzzy lookup technique and a different crate.
